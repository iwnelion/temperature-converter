## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

starting with a simple form, a js function takes the user's input in the textbox and does the conversion. after entering a number, the user chooses between two radio buttons: one for conversion to Fahrenheit and one for Celsius. after clicking the convert button, the function is fired and the result is displayed in a paragraph under the button. if the user clicks on the button without choosing a radio button, a message will appear in the result paragraph, reminding them to pick a unit.
